STATIC DOCUMENT: this content never changes during a session. Read once,
do not re-read.

## What this server is

Access to a CAS genesisWorld CRM via its REST API v7.0. Tools are either
atomic (one API operation) or flows (one tool, several operations bundled
server-side). In read-only mode, mutating tools are not registered — if you
see no create/update/delete tools, that is why, not an error.

## Domain model — the 6 concepts that matter

1. **Data object**: every record (appointment, task, address, …) is a data
   object with a type and a GGUID (globally unique ID). All generic tools
   take \`dataObjectType\` + \`dataObjectGGUID\`.
2. **Types — native vs. custom**: native types ship with genesisWorld
   (ADDRESS, APPOINTMENT, TASK, DOCUMENT, EMAILSTORE, GWOPPORTUNITY, …) and
   may have dedicated tools/flows here. Custom types are customer-created;
   they work exclusively through the generic data-object tools. Discover
   what this installation has via \`list_available_data_object_types\`
   (includes your permissions) and \`get_data_object_types_metadata\`
   (field schemas).
3. **Views**: server-side saved filters/column sets per type, often the
   fastest path to "the records the user actually means" (e.g. a "My open
   tasks" view). \`list_views\` → \`list_data_objects_by_view\`.
4. **Links**: typed relations between objects (e.g. task → address).
   \`list_links\` lists them; \`get_primary_link_parents\` resolves the
   primary parent (e.g. the company an opportunity belongs to).
5. **Dossier**: the full activity file of an object — linked records,
   documents, journal. \`get_dossier\` returns it in one call.
6. **Tags**: user-assigned labels, system-wide (\`list_tags\`) and
   per-object (\`get_object_tags\`).

## Flows (bundled multi-step tools — prefer these)

- \`my_open_tasks\`: current user + their task list in one call (due
  window via \`dueWithinDays\`, saved view via \`viewId\`).
- \`task_overview\`: one task + its links + tags, one call.
- \`create_task\`: create a task and link it to a target object, one call.
- \`find_contact\`: full-text and/or phone-number address search, one call.
- \`contact_360\`: address + collection dossier + tags + links, one call.
- \`create_address_safe\`: duplicate check first; creates only when no
  candidates are found (or with \`force: true\`).
- \`create_appointment_safe\`: optional conflict check first, then create,
  then add participants — one call.

## Navigation patterns (cheapest path first)

- **"Find X"** → \`smart_search\` (full-text, all types, supports
  object-type narrowing). Then \`get_data_object\` for details.
- **"List my/all Y"** → check \`list_views\` for a matching view first;
  fall back to \`list_data_objects\` with \`search\`/time filters.
- **"Everything about X"** → \`get_dossier\` (one call), not N × \`list_links\`
  + fetches.
- **Unknown installation?** → \`list_available_data_object_types\` once,
  then stop re-discovering.

## Efficiency rules

- Always pass \`fields\` where supported — full records are large.
- Use \`page\` / \`entriesPerPage\` (default page sizes can be big); prefer
  small pages plus \`get_data_object_count\` over fetching everything.
- \`*_full\` variants return every field — use only when you need them.
- Dates/times are ISO 8601; GGUIDs are opaque strings, never guess them.
- Updates require the object's current ETag (If-Match).
  \`update_data_object\` fetches it automatically — pass \`etag\` from a
  fresh read to save that round trip. A rejected update means the object
  changed concurrently: re-read, then retry with the new ETag.
